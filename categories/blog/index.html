Answer
Reset the AquaRite salt chlorination system and check the cell light.
Alternatively, if the Inspect Cell Light is the only LED light that is flashing, you may reset it by pressing and holding the diagnostic button for three seconds before releasing it. It will now be reset, and it will subsequently turn back on once another 500 hours of usage has elapsed.
