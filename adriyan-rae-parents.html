If you've been watching the show then you know Adriyan plays Gianna Mackey, who was initially <a href=# rel=nofollow>described</a> to us as “a lovable troublemaker with a twinkle in her eye."&nbsp;</p><p>She's funny and all-around endearing, and a great addition to <a href=#>Chicago Fire</a>. Her character comes from a working-class family who worked hard, and are beloved by their community.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This makes Gianna stand out, since she's more likely to be welcoming to people (and vice versa). Fans love that, as kind as Gianna is, she doesn't take any BS either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><br>In September, Adriyan wrote on Instagram "I have been auditioning for the Chicago shows for almost 2 years now. It truly is a marathon; and the persistence really paid off! I’m GRATEFUL, EXCITED, OVERJOYED… (Im actually not sure I can find the exact words to express it) but I’m so freakin grateful and excited to be joining the phenomenal cast of @nbcchicagofire !! I finally get to put these medical degrees to use all while being surrounded by some of the best to ever do it!”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If you've done any digging into Adriyan's life, you might know that a) she's actually a medical lab scientist, and b) she was raised by her single mom — which we could totally see as something that gives the actress that kind perseverance. Did we mention she's a pro athlete too? Her mom expected a lot out of her, from what it sounds like.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Adriyan Rae's parents?</h2><p>While we don't know their names, we do know that she was brought up by her single mom and that Adriyan is of Black American, German, Native American, and Venezuelan descent. On Adriyan's website says her mom let her play sports in school as long as she put academics first. Per the website, Adriyan's mom said "If you would've asked Adriyan at the age of eight years old what she wanted to be when she grew up she would have replied, 'a cardiothoracic surgeon'."&nbsp;</p><p>Not only is Adriyan a medical scientist, but she plays a paramedic on Chicago Fire. Talk about a killer career!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We know that in 2015, she and her sister walked her mother down the aisle to remarry back in 2015. In a touching post, Adriyan wrote, "This picture was taken recently at my mother's wedding. Unfortunately my late grandfather passed 2 year ago and was unable to walk my mother down the aisle. So instead; my sister and I walked my mother down the aisle and gave her away. The most beautiful part is; that if you look closely in the bouquet, you'll see a picture of my grandfather, (presented to my mother by her sisters) in the roses so that in a way; he walked her down the aisle as well."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Adriyan stays pretty private on social media, so we don't know much else about her family — and she's never publicly spoken about her biological father.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Chicago Fire every Wednesday night at 9 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrGztdiapWaqkZp6sa3RnqWtqw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadriyan-rae-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fadriyan-rae-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fadriyan-rae-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fadriyan-rae-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadriyan-rae-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadriyan-rae-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./editors-picks-summer-fashion-7484201.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./editors-picks-summer-fashion-7484201.html>All the Summer Fashion InStyle Staffers Cant Get Enough Of</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./comment-page-1.html>Vegan Mayo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./comment-page-1.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
