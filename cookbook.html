My new cookbook, Love & Lemons Every Day, is out TODAY!! I’m so excited to be sitting here writing this post, because the process of making this book was a long one! About 3 years ago, I set out with SO many ideas that I wanted to pack into this book. Over time, I kept adding more and more… and more. I’d think – “Ooh, this section would be helpful,” or “Oh I’d like to have that information on hand,”&nbsp;and “Let’s add MORE dinner recipes,” etc, etc. As I got carried away, the process got longer, the book…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Hello, happy Saturday! Our new cookbook, Love & Lemons Every Day, is coming out in just 3 weeks! To celebrate, we’re giving away&nbsp;250&nbsp;of these limited edition Love & Lemons Every Day tote bags. How cute are they?? But, first thing’s first – a peek of what’s in the book! More than 100 all-new, vegetarian recipes. Many of you have asked me if the recipes are all vegetarian. The answer is YES, they are, but they’ve all been tested on meat-eaters as well.

I haven’t been overly secretive about it, but it’s official… 288 pages of never-been-blogged-before vegetable-ey goodness will be out next April! (I know, I know, a whole year away – I promise it’ll be worth the wait). It’s being published by Penguin US and Penguin Canada, the teams behind some of my favorite books including&nbsp;Oh She Glows and What Katie Ate. We’ve been hard at work for months now and I can’t wait&nbsp;to show you how it’s coming together!&nbsp;I’ll be sharing updates and previews…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Back before there were a (seemingly) endless number of food blogs on the internet, there were a few I followed pretty religiously.&nbsp;101 Cookbooks,&nbsp;Sprouted Kitchen,&nbsp;Seven Spoons, and one of my all time favorites: Kimberly Hasselbrink’s&nbsp;The Year in Food. I was new to the idea of blogs, but suddenly I spent all my time at the office procrastinating instead of working. What I was going to make that night for dinner became&nbsp;far&nbsp;more important to me that any client project I had on my plate.

I ground up my own polenta from popcorn! Who knew it was as easy as that? This recipe comes from The Homemade Flour Cookbook, by Erin of Naturally Ella. Erin is one of by best blog friends (BBF’s forever!), and I couldn’t be more proud of her and her beautiful new book. She breaks down the basics of making your own flour out of all sorts of grains, seeds, nuts, and legumes. It’s also packed with recipes for each type…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love cookbooks and I hoard them pretty obsessively. Although, I’ll admit, I have a hard time following recipes from start to finish. Which is why I love the premise of Kate Payne’s new book,&nbsp;The Hip Girls Guide to the Kitchen. It’s a “hit the ground running approach, seeing as you need to eat three times daily whether you’ve mastered your kitchen or not.” It’s full of, really, everything you need to know to be pretty successful in your kitchen – from how to set up your pantry to how to put meals together intuitively and economically.

Technically it’s fall, but I still have a ton of eggplant, zucchini and other summer vegetables scattered around my countertops. And this rainbow colored vegetable tian was quite possibly the perfect way to celebrate them. (Plus, it was ridiculously fun to make). This recipe is from chef John Besh’s Cooking from the Heart, which comes out next week.
