I thought it would be a one-and-done lunch—just an easy way to use up my leftovers—but to my surprise, I got hooked. Before long, I was boiling more&nbsp;eggs to make&nbsp;more&nbsp;egg salad. This stuff is seriously good! This egg salad recipe is brighter and fresher than most. In my opinion, it’s what a classic egg salad recipe really wants&nbsp;to be. It’s still rich, creamy, and flavorful, but it uses far less mayo than is traditional. Lemon juice, Dijon mustard,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Here’s the good news: perfect hard boiled eggs are easy to make. …And the bad news: so are less-than-perfect ones. I don’t know about you, but I’ve certainly cooked my fair share of the latter. When you try to peel away the shell, half the whites come along with it, or when you cut it open, the yolk is slightly green instead of brilliant yellow. Pretty disappointing, if you ask me. See, cooking perfect hard boiled eggs is easy, but that doesn’t mean that the process you use doesn’t matter.

If you said classic carrot cake or baby carrots and dip, you’re probably not alone. But I’m sharing 40+ of my best carrot recipes here in the hopes that you’ll try cooking this bright orange vegetable in a new way. They might seem humble, but carrots are insanely versatile. Roasted carrots make a wonderful side dish, for example, and carrot ginger soup is the perfect cozy meal for a cold day. Tangy pickled carrots are great for snacking, while a fresh carrot salad could be the star of your next picnic.

It’s a change from my usual breakfast casserole or frittata, and though it’s (much) more time-intensive, every second is worth it. This spinach quiche is melt-in-your mouth delicious. It has a buttery, flaky crust and a custardy egg filling that’s flecked with tender spinach, green onions, and salty feta cheese. If you’re tempted to try it, you can find my step-by-step guide to how to make quiche below, complete with all my best tips for quiche success.

If you’re hosting a party or looking for a dish to bring to one, I promise—these easy appetizer recipes will not disappoint. They range from indulgent dips to bite-sized finger foods, gorgeous snack boards, and baked treats. These appetizers are the nibbles and bites that I love to serve when I’m entertaining. They’re simple to make (and often make ahead) and easy to serve (bonus points if you don’t need utensils!). But most importantly, they’re fun and delicious. They keep the prep straightforward for you while delivering big, bold flavors for guests.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>To me, roasted carrots are the perfect veggie side dish.&nbsp;They’re easy to make, but they’re also amazingly flavorful. The hot oven intensifies the carrots’ natural sweetness, and it makes them soft and tender, with lightly crisp, caramelized edges. I can never resist eating some straight off the baking sheet! You’ll find my favorite roasted carrots recipe below. In addition to the olive oil, salt, and pepper I’d toss with any roasted vegetable, I use some honey here. It lightly glazes the carrots and helps them brown and caramelize in the oven.

My family had them at our holiday dinner every year when I was growing up. Cheesy, rich, and comforting, they were my favorite part of the meal. I’d happily skip the Easter ham and go back for a second serving of scalloped potatoes instead! Since this classic dish is one of my Easter favorites, I wanted to share a recipe for it this spring. Finally—after lots of testing and tweaking—it’s here: my favorite scalloped potatoes recipe. It features tender potatoes baked in a creamy sauce with fresh thyme, onions, and cheddar cheese.&nbsp;…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Easter is right around the corner, and I’m busy picking out which side dishes to make for our holiday feast. No offense to ham or lamb, but the side dishes are always my favorite part of Easter dinner. If you ask me, they’re what make the meal memorable. Seasonal vegetables like carrots and asparagus add a pop of color to the table. Hearty potato recipes keep guests coming back for more. And spring salads like my strawberry salad or carrot salad offer bright, fresh flavor.

They’re easy to make. They’re as cute as can be. And while they satisfy my sweet tooth, they’re not just&nbsp;sweet. Matcha powder gives these cookies complexity.&nbsp;If you’re not familiar with matcha, it’s a Japanese green tea powder made from shade-grown, finely ground green tea leaves. Its earthy, grassy, and subtly bitter taste shines through in these cookies, balancing their sweetness perfectly. Bonus: it makes them bright green! These matcha cookies have crisp edges, tender middles, and a white chocolate shell on top. They’re unique and delicious. You have to try them!

If you like, you can add a dash of hot sauce or a pinch of paprika to kick the flavors up a notch. But without them, your deviled eggs will still be delicious. Because classic deviled eggs are so tasty AND so simple, they’re a perfect appetizer for Easter, the holidays, parties…any occasion, really.
