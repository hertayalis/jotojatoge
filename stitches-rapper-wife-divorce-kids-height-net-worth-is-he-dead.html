<time>17 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Popular for promoting drugs and violence in his videos, Phillip Nickolas Katsabanis, aka Stitches, is an American rapper Brick in the Face.&nbsp;Neglecting that, he was able to gain significant attention with songs like&nbsp;Pounds in My Bag, Molly Cyrus,&nbsp;and&nbsp;One Million Pennies.</p><p><span>This musician had a few scores to settle with fellow rappers, which earned him extensive media coverage and greater visibility.&nbsp;For example, he released the track&nbsp;</span><span>Fear Not Death</span><span>&nbsp;which was targeted on the game. Reportedly, he was punched in the face and knocked out by the rapper’s manager, Wack 100.</span></p><p><span>There are more dramas surrounding this guy, let us learn more about his biography, career, wealth, family and even body traits, we have covered almost everything.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Stitches’ Biography,</span></strong></h2><p><span>Everyone knows that Stitches was born to Esther and Alex Katsabanis on June 17, 1995 and his birthplace was in Miami, Florida, United States.&nbsp;He is one of the non-black rappers in the music business, of Cuban and Greek descent.&nbsp;His parents’ union ended when he was one year old and he has two older siblings from his parents’ marriage – brothers Alex Jr and Dimitri.&nbsp;He attended G. Holmes Braddock High School in Miami-Dade County, where he later dropped out.</span></p><p><span>Rumor has it that he was expelled from school for punching the principal in the face.&nbsp;According to the story, Stitches moved to South Beach, Florida and got into selling drugs and guns to make ends meet.&nbsp;This report is corroborated by several claims from his siblings;&nbsp;obviously, his bad boy act started long before he hit the music scene and won over hip-hop fans.</span></p><p><span>Stitches began his rap career under the stage name Lil Phil.&nbsp;Back in 2012, he released the track,&nbsp;</span><span>My Name Lil Phil</span><span>&nbsp;but he ditched the moniker at age 16 and started performing under the stage name Stitches.&nbsp;His debut mixtape titled,&nbsp;</span><span>No Statement Is My Statement</span><span>&nbsp;was released in 2014. The tape spawned the hit song,&nbsp;</span><span>Brick in the Face</span><span>&nbsp;and its video has since garnered over 26 million views on YouTube.&nbsp;In 2015, he went further to release two more mixtapes,&nbsp;</span><span>Brick Bible</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Soft and Ask and</span><span>&nbsp;eventually followed up with the release of his debut album,&nbsp;</span><span>For Drug Dealers Only</span><span>&nbsp;in the same year.</span></p><p><span>The following year, his second album titled&nbsp;</span><span>Tales of a Drug Lord</span><span>&nbsp;was released.&nbsp;The album included the track&nbsp;</span><span>Pain and Success</span><span>&nbsp;which was well received.&nbsp;In 2017, he embarked on the following projects:&nbsp;</span><span>I Need Rehab</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Cocaine Vacation</span><span>, and The Trap House.</span></p><p><span>The rapper’s music is inspired by artists such as Gucci Mane, Whiz Khalifa and Juicy J who have impressed music audiences with their talents.&nbsp;He also tapped into the artistry of acts such as Trace Cyrus, Blac Youngsta, Compton Menace and Fat Trel.</span></p><p><span>Stitches’ profile didn’t help counter the stereotype of crime and violence associated with rappers in the music industry.&nbsp;He was arrested individually.&nbsp;in 2017, he faced drug and firearms charges in Miami, Florida.&nbsp;Police found weed, a gun, ammunition and other incriminating items in his possession.&nbsp;His lawyer was able to find him a good plea in the firearms case.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth – How Wealthy Is It?</span></strong></h2><p><span>This rapper is said to have an estimated net worth of $500,000.&nbsp;Katsabanis has managed to attract more than 1.6 million fans on Instagram and almost 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel.&nbsp;Although these paths helped him accumulate his wealth, much of his wealth came from his music career.&nbsp;Although it is widely believed that drug trafficking is the main source of his wealth, we cannot authenticate this sentiment.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His wife, his divorce and his children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Stitches was once married to Erica Duarte, who has eleven years on him;&nbsp;he was just seventeen when he married her.&nbsp;She served as his legal assistant before becoming his wife in the fall of 2012. Erica featured in Paris Hilton&nbsp;</span><span>y New BFF</span><span>&nbsp;in 2008. The couple separated in 2017 after five years of marriage and Erica Duarte has been on a downward spiral ever since. their divorce.</span></p><p><span>Their union produced three children, Rex, Rocco and Evelyn.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Characteristics of point size and body</span></strong></h2><p><span>Rapper Brick in Yo Face is a tall guy, standing at 6ft 1in (186cm).&nbsp;He is also chubby.&nbsp;The rapper has stitch tattoos on his mouth to back up his nickname.&nbsp;He also has a tattooed teddy bear on his forehead, Ak-47 tattoos as well as the word cocaine on his arm.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is he dead?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Recently, rumors of the rapper’s death have been circulating social media with images and articles.&nbsp;He made no vocal attempt to directly dispel rumors that would make this look like a publicity stunt meant to improve the rapper’s career.&nbsp;As far as we know, Stitches the Rapper is very much alive.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGirpJ7BpLTErGSrmaClsrN51qKdnmWUnsOwvsKeZKShlKh6qbHIoJ%2BtZZ6awW7DzquroWWZqHqpsYydnJqcXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstitches-rapper-wife-divorce-kids-height-net-worth-is-he-dead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstitches-rapper-wife-divorce-kids-height-net-worth-is-he-dead.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstitches-rapper-wife-divorce-kids-height-net-worth-is-he-dead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstitches-rapper-wife-divorce-kids-height-net-worth-is-he-dead.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstitches-rapper-wife-divorce-kids-height-net-worth-is-he-dead.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstitches-rapper-wife-divorce-kids-height-net-worth-is-he-dead.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./superman-legacy-eyeing-a-certified-scream-queen-for-lois-lane-proves-dcu-and-horror-addicts-that-dreams-do-come-true.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./superman-legacy-eyeing-a-certified-scream-queen-for-lois-lane-proves-dcu-and-horror-addicts-that-dreams-do-come-true.html>Superman: Legacy eyeing a certified scream queen for Lois Lane proves DCU and horror addicts t</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./september-17-birthday-zodiac-virgo-devoted.html>September 17 Zodiac Horoscope Birthday Personality</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./september-17-birthday-zodiac-virgo-devoted.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
