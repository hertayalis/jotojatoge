The two women started arguing about the post with other people around.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On Instagram Live, Vicky explained that she and Chrisean were friends before the incident transpired. However, once the ladies realized that Vicky liked the TikTok post, they told Chrisean. Vicky made it a point to apologize since Chrisean was offended.</p><p>“I don’t have a problem with saying sorry first,” Vicky said. "Like I said, I didn’t come on that show to fight."</p><p>Vicky then explained that Chrisean didn’t accept the apology and accused her of playing scared now that she was being confronted. However, Vicky made it a point to apologize again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“No, for real, I’m sorry,” Vicky said. I don’t want to fight. I swear on everything, I didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p>Vicky explained that while another young lady on the show believed what she was saying, Chrisean wasn’t going for it. Chrisean then decided to pick up something and throw it at her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“My emotions were overwhelmed at that point because I thought me and [Chrisean] got along,” Vicky said. “I didn’t know she was going to believe someone she saw on the internet versus asking me."</p><p>Vicky also said that if it wasn’t for the security guards, Chrisean would have attacked her.

Vicky expressed that other folks present could have helped her but they chose not to.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“It was definitely a set-up, though,” Vicky said.</p><p>Additionally, Vicky didn’t go into detail about why she filed charges, we just now know that Vicky has taken the legal route. She also said that she doesn’t care about being called “scary” and “a rat.”</p><p>The post concluded with photos of Vicky’s face with cuts and bruises.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Zeus network founder and CEO Lemuel Plummer has discredited rumors about Chrisean Rock and Woah Vicky’s incident.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All Hip Hop</a>, Zeus founder and CEO Lemuel Plummer is calling cap (aka nonsense) about the rumors of Woah Vicky and Chrisean Rock being physical with one another.</p><p>In now-deleted Instagram story shared by the site, Lemuel claims that the fight never happened on the set of Baddies East.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>“Chrisean Rock has NOT gotten into a physical altercation with ANYONE on set during the filming of Baddies East,” Lemuel wrote per the site. “Anyone claiming otherwise is ALL [cap emoji].”</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t help that Chrisean’s ex-boyfriend, rapper Blueface, also spread the rumors, making some folks believe they're true.</p><p>“SMH, I told her not to go on that show. Free my son,” Blueface wrote in a now-deleted tweet.</p><p>Now that Vicky has filed a report with the authorities, it will be interesting to see how things move forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBnquwnZWjeri7wKFkr6GToMZurc2dZJygop7Apq3NZqmom5s%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-woah-vicky-and-chrisean-rock.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-woah-vicky-and-chrisean-rock.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-woah-vicky-and-chrisean-rock.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-woah-vicky-and-chrisean-rock.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-woah-vicky-and-chrisean-rock.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-woah-vicky-and-chrisean-rock.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-to-maya-kowalski-where-is-maya-kowalski-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-to-maya-kowalski-where-is-maya-kowalski-now.html>What Happened to Maya Kowalski: Where is Maya Kowalski Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./73319-selena-gomez-braless-a-tight-tee-cut-den-html.html>Selena Gomez seen braless in a tight tee and cut-off denim shorts as she enjoys a night out</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./73319-selena-gomez-braless-a-tight-tee-cut-den-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
