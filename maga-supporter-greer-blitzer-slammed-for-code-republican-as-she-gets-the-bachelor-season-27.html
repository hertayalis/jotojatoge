Greer explained herself as someone who is "bold, doesn't take s**t, and is very kind." Well, she came up with a cup of coffee as she walked in towards <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zach</a>. As she offered the coffee to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'The Bachelor' Season 27</a> lead, she said, "It might be piping hot just like you." She further revealed to have a soft spot for Zach because he lives in Austin, Texas. However, fans believe that Greer was not worth receiving the first rose. A lot of them were shocked seeing her get the first rose, wondering what exactly she did to stand out. After doing a lot of digging on Greer as she bagged the first rose, a fan claimed her to be a MAGA supporter.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Where was ‚ÄòThe Bachelor‚Äô Season 27 filmed?
