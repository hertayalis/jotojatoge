His death was confirmed on Tuesday, September 26, 2023, leaving the hearts of many broken as they learned of his untimely departure. Billy Soul Bonds was not only a talented musician but also a significant influence on the newer generation of artists. His songs resonated deeply with audiences and will continue to be cherished by fans worldwide.</p><p>Billy “Soul” Bonds was born in Brisco, Arkansas, a place along the famed deep-blues axis of Clarksdale, Mississippi, and Helena, Arkansas. He made his mark on the music scene in the mid-1980s when he recorded for M&T. Over the next two decades, he continued to release music on various independent labels, touring the southern circuit of clubs and show lounges. Slowly but steadily, he built a reputation as a soulful vocalist, earning his stage name, “Soul,” thanks to his powerful and emotive singing. His performances were known for their impish and often risqué sense of humor, captivating audiences wherever he went.</p><p>However, it wasn’t until he joined Malaco/Waldoxy and recorded “Scat Cat, Here Kitty, Kitty” on the 2006 “Here Kitty, Kitty” CD that he became a household name. This playful yet sensuous song, filled with clever sexual innuendos set against a backdrop of romantic balladry, became one of the year’s biggest soul blues hits. It gave rise to a virtual cottage industry of songs exploring the relationships between men and women with tongue-in-cheek humor.</p><p>Billy Soul Bonds’ music touched the hearts of many, and his charismatic performances left a lasting impression on all who had the privilege of seeing him live. His contributions to the soul and blues genres will not be forgotten, and he will be greatly missed by his family, friends, and fans.</p><p>Robert Brown shared his sorrow on the death of Billy Soul Bonds. He stated in his post that:</p><p>R.I.P. BILLY SOUL BONDS!<br>I was at work when I received the terrible news. Southern Soul recording artist and my dear friend, Billy Soul Bonds passed away. It’s getting harder for me to wrap my mind around the fact that so many artist from a time period I loved so dearly are passing away.<br>I have very fond memories with Billy Soul Bonds. I was in Jackson,Mississippi for a show and he asked where I was staying because he wanted to take me out to eat..He arrived at my hotel with the late recording artist, Pat Brown. He took me to The Big Apple Inn on Farrish Street and when we arrived, we were joined by the legendary Bobby Rush. The time spent with the three of them made me forget I was with recording artist, I was in the presence of genuine friends.<br>His music had an impact on the newer generation. I remember my son was in junior high school and one day the teacher had each student to get before the class and sing a song. There have been millions of songs written from different genres of music, this boy sung, “Scat Cat, Here Kitty Kitty”. Billy was so tickled when I told him about this. 🤣🤣🤣<br>Today the blues and southern soul genre of music has truly lost a great artist and much more than that a great man. My thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult time. Soul Heaven just got a little more soulful today. I’m gonna miss you buddy! 🙏🙏🙏🙏<br>R.I.P.
